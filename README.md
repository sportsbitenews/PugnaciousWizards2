PugnaciousWizards2
==================
Follow up to the 2013 7DRL PugnaciousWizards.


A short roguelike focusing on interesting traps, interesting magic, and being easy to play.

Traps are interesting because you can see them and use them to your advantage.

Magic is interesting because spells have multiple effects.

Easy to play because of the streamlined interface and help system. The complexity comes from the interactions of terrain, creatures, traps, and spells.
