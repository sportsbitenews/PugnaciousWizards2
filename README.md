PugnaciousWizards2
==================

Follow up to the 2013 7DRL PugnaciousWizards.

A short roguelike focusing on interesting traps, interesting magic, and being easy to play.

Traps are interesting because you can see them and use them to your advantage.

Magic is interesting because spells have multiple effects.

Easy to play because of the streamlined interface and help system.

Also an attempt to write a roguelike with Test Driven Development. Most of it is easy, but some parts - like worldgen or maze algorithms - have been difficult. Difficult because of the randomness and because Flash really isn't suited to fast feedback loops and alternate runners that TDD works best with.
